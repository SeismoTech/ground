Ground = General ROUtiNes Definition
======================================================================

Code shared across several projects.

To simplify dependency management, this project is evolved as a rolling
version project, where all changes are always backward compatible.
Therefore, it will be forever at 1.x.0 version;
major version will never change because that would mean an incompable change;
and there is no need to move patch version, because any bugfix can be
seen as a new compatible enhancement.
